                        MEET MIKAELA
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Mikaela’s background in kinesiology combined with a lifetime of holistic healing practice gives her the unique ability to empower people, adding in striking balance and harmony within the mindbody. It’s not just about food and exercise; Mikaela uses human connection to intuitively meet her client’s needs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mikaela’s philosophy is rooted in biodiversity; the understanding that each body has unique needs and must follow a personal path to optimal health. If happiness starts in the body, then food must be the key. Whether it’s in the form of food, love, or experiences, the choice of what we use to fuel ourselves with will affect who we are and how we grow into our healthiest and truest selves.

                            When Mikaela was 17, her father had a heart attack. Instead of using the traditional Western approach, he vowed to use lifestyle and food to heal himself. He lost 70lbs by eating whole foods and taking worldly supplements in all forms to miraculously regain his strength and improve his vitality. It was so successful, he achieved a mind and body state far better than before he fell ill.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After watching this real life example of food as medicine, Mikaela began immersing herself further in the study of food and healing traditions. She started training under well-recognized, LA-based chef Wayne Forman and decided to leave her masters in Physical Therapy to continue her pursuit of food and nutrition. After more than 10 years of studying nutrition, food, and the physical body, Mikaela has found her passion and loves sharing her secret ingredients for health and happiness. #EatToLove
